<h1 style="text-align: center">  Fire Detection System </h1>

## Inspiration

Uncontrolled Fire can cause destruction and lot of problems. It is necessary to control fire before it can spread over wide area. This system is designed to alert user in case of an unwanted fire so that it can be controlled and problems can be avoided. This system will be best for fire safety of Homes and other small areas.

## What it does

This system uses a gas sensor to detect fire. A LED and buzzer to alert user. When there no fire a safe signal is indicated through Green LED, in case of fire the Gas sensor senses it and the buzzer starts along with a Red LED.

## How I built it

I have used Tinkercad software for simulation. Arduino is also used for combining different components and sensors. Coding is done using Embedded C.

## Challenges I ran into

Gas sensor is analog in nature. The challenge was to set a specific range after which the sensor can send signal to buzzer.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

I have successfully integrated hardware and software using Arduino and Embedded C.

## What I learned

I have got an understanding of Embedded C and different sensor. In future I'll be looking to make more projects using Arduino.

## What's next for Fire Detection System

In future this system can be modified to cover a large area and other sensors like temperature sensor can also be added which will make the system better. Also a push button can be added in case a user wants to start the alarm.
